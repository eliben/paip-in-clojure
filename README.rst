PAIP in Clojure
---------------

Peter Norvig's *"Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies
in Common Lisp"* (a.k.a. PAIP) is one of my all-time favorite programming books.
I think it's amazing and well worth going through even if you're not interested
in Lisp or AI, just for the depth and breadth of solid advice and excellent code
it contains.

This project is my attempt to go through PAIP again, this time meticulously
reimplementing all programs in `Clojure <http://clojure.org/>`_, a modern flavor
of Lisp running on the JVM or in the browser.

At this time there are two Clojure projects here:

* ``paip``: Translation of PAIP code to Clojure, organized (roughly) by chapter
  name.
* ``cl-in-clj``: A "Common Lisp to Clojure" cheatsheet of sorts. Contains code
  samples/walkthroughs to answer the question "how do we do this Common Lisp
  thing in Clojure". See its README file for more details.
