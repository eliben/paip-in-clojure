PAIP in Clojure
---------------

Peter Norvig's *"Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies
in Common Lisp"* (a.k.a. PAIP) is one of my all-time favorite programming books.
I think it's amazing and well worth going through even if you're not interested
in Lisp or AI, just for the depth and breadth of solid advice and excellent code
it contains.

This project is my attempt to go through PAIP, meticulously reimplementing all
programs in `Clojure <http://clojure.org/>`_, a modern flavor of Lisp running on
the JVM or in the browser.

``cl-in-clj`` contains code samples/walkthroughs with direct translations from
Common Lisp to Clojure. See its README file for more details.
